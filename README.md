##Description
For this project I created a Music visulizer on a infinte track, in this project I used unity to create visual elements that react to the music that is being played in the scene.
the user can move forward and look around as they do this a path will be built in front of them with randomized colored cubes being spawned on eaither side, as the user walks forward the path behind them will fall away and be destroyed.
always in fron of the player is a large pulsating sphere with cylinders and rings around it all reacting to the music this sphere will always stay the same amount of distance from the player.

To run this please clone the repo and open it in unity this project was developed in unity version 2019.2.14f



##Development
To create this project I used the what I had learned in the module as well as the scripts avaliable in the class repo. I also watched many diffrent tutorials on youtube the main one that was a big help was by a youtuber called Peer play especial his series on audio visualization, the rest of the project was developed with extensive use of the unity documentation.

##Notes
To me the visulizer feels a bit flat I think all the scripts and systems are there to make something that really Pops and is visually immersive. I do think that the way the path is endless and there is some randomization in the Cubes along the Path make it intresting but the big sphre that follows the user could have been built on. 
another thing that I was not able to get working right was having the path rise up rather than just spawn infront of the player.

###Propsal

My idea for the project is to create a VR procedrualy generated visulizer game that will be design to work best for ambient drone and post-rock genres of music
